# hello-world

This is my relearning of GitHub to add myriad projects to the site for presentation and organization. I'm currently a front-end dev working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In addition, I've worked with VB, C++, Java and others that i hope to add to bolster my GitHub. 

And now a litlle bit about myself, mostly in non-sequiturs:

Believe I've covered just about everything. This is a bit ridiculous for me to write all this, but it's both good for me to reference and hold myself to these goals. If you've made it this far, I commend you for... something, I'm just not certain what.
