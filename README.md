# hello-world

This is my relearning of GitHub to add myriad projects to the site for presentation and organization. I'm currently a front-end dev working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In addition, I've worked with VB, C++, Java and others that i hope to add to bolster my GitHub. 

And now a litlle bit about myself, mostly in non-sequiturs:
- Born and currently in Louisville, KY
- Live in the Old Louisville area, between Churchill Downs and University of Louisville
- Currently attending Murray State University, for my Bachelors' in Business - CIS
- Planning on either attending law school, specializing in IT Law, or acquiring my Master's in Information Sciences
- Active in boxing, cycling and, weather permitting, tennis
- Avid reader, former librarian of 10 years
- NBA fan, Knicks, unfortunately
- Currently in weight loss: Started at 230, now at 220, gunning for 188. May write program to show progress
- Current goal of reading 53 books in 2016. May write program to show progress
- Current goal of learning Spanish: May write program to show progress
- Current goal of mastering JavaScript. Will write JS to show progress
- Also want to learn new technologies and brush up on dormant technologies I've learned
- Unemployed, currently looking for work in Design, Development, Big Data, and General IT

Believe I've covered just about everything. This is a bit ridiculous for me to write all this, but it's both good for me to reference and hold myself to these goals. If you've made it this far, I commend you for... something, I'm just not certain what.
